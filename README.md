### Professional Biography

I am a fifth-year Computer Science major. I am most interested in backend and full-stack software development. I chose the field of computer science to make products for people to use. Making tasks easier for users is my main motivation. I also want to get more involved in and learn more about new techniques like AI, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning.

### Co-op Work Experience

I have completed 4 co-ops in industry and 1 co-op as an EEP. My industry co-op experiences are detailed below - 

* Co-op 1 and 2 - Spring 2022, Fall 2022 - FedEx Ground - Computer Science Co-op - I worked on the Operations Analysis team and helped with report generation and automation. I used a lot of SQL queries for database manipulation. I helped in automating 2 reports with the help of VBA scripting and logic which helped the team generate the same data in <5mins which was >30mins earlier. 

* Co-op 3 and 5 - Summer 2023, Summer 2024 - Dell Technologies - Software Engineer Intern - I worked on the ObjectScale and AIOps teams over two rotations. My work here dealt with creating or updating internal tools that helped monitor server health, product pipelines, etc. I used a lot of full-stack technologies to develop these tools. I gained experience with Python, Java, PostgreSQL, SpringBoot, JavaScript, etc.
